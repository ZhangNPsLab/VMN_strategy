MZmol is an open-source online service platform designed to assist researchers in easily utilizing **in-silico MS/MS data**. It automates the generation of:

- **Neutral loss mass spectra**
- **Characteristic mass spectrometry data**
- **Filtering of targeted metabolite networks**

This enables the identification and isolation of **unknown compounds** from **unknown metabolites**, a strategy we refer to as the **Virtual Molecular Network (VMN) approach**.

## Current Technology

Currently, MZmol utilizes the open-source **CFM-ID 4.0** model for generating **in-silico MS/MS data**. As the precision of simulated mass spectrometry data continues to improve, more advanced models will be incorporated in future updates, further enhancing compound mass spectra prediction capabilities.
