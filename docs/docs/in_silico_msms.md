# In Silico MS/MS Data of Virtual Molecules

The **In silico MS/MS data** module is designed to help users obtain MS/MS data for **virtual molecules** that cannot be generated through experiments.

---

## Input Requirements

Users can provide virtual molecules in one of two ways:

- **SMILES Input**:  
  Enter the **SMILES** of the virtual molecules directly, with multiple SMILES separated by spaces.

- **Batch Processing**:  
  Upload a `.txt` file containing the SMILES of the virtual molecules to generate in-silico MS/MS data in **batch mode**.

---

## Collision Energies

The in-silico MS/MS data can be generated at different **collision energies**:
- **10 eV**
- **20 eV**
- **40 eV**

> **Note**:  
> The time required to generate the MS/MS data depends on the number of molecules and the complexity of their structures. Larger sets or more complex molecules will require more time.

## Viewing and Interacting with the Data

Once the in-silico MS/MS data is generated, it will be displayed as **hyperlinks** in the results table on the right. Here's what you can do:

- **View the Spectrum**:  
  By clicking on the "Spectrum" link in the table, users can view the mass spectrum directly and interact with the data for further analysis.

- **Download the Data**:  
  Use the **download button** on the right side of the table to download the generated in-silico MS/MS data for further offline analysis.

### Quick Tips:
- Always ensure the SMILES strings are properly formatted.
- Batch processing is ideal for handling multiple molecules at once.
- The interaction feature allows for real-time exploration of the MS/MS spectrum.

With the **In silico MS/MS data module**, users can explore virtual molecules' behavior under various conditions, providing deeper insights that would be otherwise unattainable through experimental means alone.
